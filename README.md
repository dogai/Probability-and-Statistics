The reports aim to provide a clear understanding of key concepts in probability and statistics, making them accessible to learners at all 
levels. Each report breaks down complex topics into digestible sections, offering explanations, examples, and practical applications to 
enhance comprehension.

Calculation Methods:

    1. Discrete Random Variables: The report covers the calculation of probabilities for discrete random variables using probability 
    mass functions (PMFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Examples illustrate the application of these methods in various
    scenarios, such as coin flipping or dice rolling.

    2. Continuous Random Variables: Here, the focus is on calculating probabilities for continuous random variables using probability
    density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Real-world examples demonstrate how to apply these techniques to
    continuous probability distributions like the normal distribution or exponential distribution.

    3. Hypothesis Testing: The report explains the process of hypothesis testing, including formulating null and alternative hypotheses, 
    selecting appropriate test statistics, and determining critical values or p-values. Practical examples guide readers through hypothesis 
    testing procedures for various types of statistical tests, such as z-tests, t-tests, or chi-square tests.

By providing detailed explanations and step-by-step calculations, these reports empower learners to grasp essential concepts in probability
and statistics and apply them confidently in academic or practical contexts.
